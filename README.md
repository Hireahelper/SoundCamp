SoundCamp
=========

This plugin adds a sound button to your Campfire chat enabling
you to play the included sounds to other members of the chat.
It was created in the spirit of
[Kindling](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/abnakpmgckdkcpgbcejajjbllagggcif),
but the sounds will only play in browsers that have this plugin
installed (ie. these are not native Campfire sounds).

Install
=======

If you just want to install the latest version of the extension,
go to http://aelse.github.com/SoundCamp and follow the instructions.

If you want to add your own sounds you'll need to add any sounds
and images to their respective directories and modify the sounds
array in sound.js.

Credits
=======

SoundCamp uses the jQuery open source library. It also borrows
some css and javascript from Kindling for the sound menu.

Sounds and images have been added from publically available
sources.
