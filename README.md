SoundCamp
=========

This plugin adds a sound button to your Campfire chat enabling
you to play the included sounds to other members of the chat.
It was created in the spirit of
[Kindling](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/abnakpmgckdkcpgbcejajjbllagggcif),
but the sounds will only play in browsers that have this plugin
installed (ie. these are not native Campfire sounds).

Credits
=======

SoundCamp uses the jQuery open source library. It also borrows
some css and javascript from Kindling for the sound menu.

Sounds and images have been added from publically available
sources.
